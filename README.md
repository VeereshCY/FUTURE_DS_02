This project focuses on analyzing customer churn and retention patterns using subscription-based customer data. The objective is to understand why customers leave, which segments are most at risk, and what actions can improve retention.The analysis simulates real-world work done by product, growth, and retention analytics teams in SaaS and subscription-based businesses, where reducing churn directly impacts revenue and long-term growth.
Key Insights:
Month-to-month contract customers have the highest churn, indicating low commitment and high price sensitivity.
Long-term customers also show notable churn, suggesting declining engagement or reduced perceived value over time.
Contract type and tenure are strong predictors of churn behavior.
Certain payment methods and revenue segments are more prone to churn, highlighting potential friction points. 
Business Recommendations:
Encourage long-term contracts by offering incentives to convert month-to-month customers.
Re-engage long-term customers through loyalty programs, feature updates, and personalized communication.
Implement targeted retention campaigns for high-risk segments based on tenure and contract type.
Closely monitor high-revenue customers and proactively intervene before churn occurs.
